```typescript
const handle = await client.start(example, {
  args: ["Temporal"], // type inference works! args: [name: string]
  taskQueue: "your-task-queue",
  // in practice, use a meaningful business id, eg customerId or transactionId
  workflowId: "your-workflow-id-",
});
```

Contect to a Client with `client.start()` and any argyuments. Then specify your `taskQueue` and set your `workflowId` to a meaningful business identifier.
